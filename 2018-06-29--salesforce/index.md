## Speculation on a partnership with Salesforce

One of the most promising leads on ChainLink partnerships is Salesforce. As the global leader in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) they have connections with a myriad of important companies all over the world.

It all started on the 29th of March,the CEO of Salesforce when Marc Benioff gave an [interview to techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/08/salesforce-is-working-on-a-blockchain-product/) about his plans for blockchain implementations in his company. During the interview, [he tells an anecdote](https://youtu.be/2nC0TX_GCIM?t=1965) about the World Economic Forum (Davos 2018) and cryptocurrency.  

The techcrunch interview gives a nice roundup on what he tells in the video interview:
> [...] A bit of serendipity led him to start thinking about blockchain and how it could be used as part of the Salesforce  family of products. As it turned out, there was a crypto conference going on at the same time as the WEF and the two worlds collided at a Salesforce event at the Intercontinental Hotel. While there, one of the crypto conference attendees engaged Benioff in a conversation and it was the start of something.
“I had been thinking a lot about what is Salesforce’s strategy around blockchain, and what is Salesforce’s strategies around cryptocurrencies and how will we relate to all of these things,” Benioff said. He is actually a big believer in the power of serendipity, and he said just by having that conversation, it started him down the road to thinking more seriously about Salesforce’s role in this developing technology.
He said the more he thought about it, the more he believed that Salesforce could make use of Blockchain. Then suddenly something clicked for him and he saw a way to put blockchain and cryptocurrencies to work in Salesforce. “That’s kind of how it works and I hope by Dreamforce we will have a blockchain and cryptocurrency solution.”

As we now when Davos 2018 was held, we know this meeting was around the 26th of january 2018. It's extremely likely the cryptocurrency conference [he speaks about was CryptoHQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thdR046ES04). So, who was this mystery man who was attending the Crypto conference and managed to woo Marc Benioff? **We think it might be Sergey Nazarov, CEO of Chainlink.** 

There is however no hard proof - there is very little video material on the crypto conference, and so far we haven't managed to find evidence Sergey was there. Yet, on the 20th of February, [Sergey tweeted this](https://twitter.com/SergeyNazarov/status/965781130539511809):
>“We heard the same concern over and over again: a panic over giving up control.” is how @Benioff described initial reactions to SaaS replacing on-premise, until the value of SaaS won out. It'll be the same story with Smart Contracts, as their ability to deliver value improves. 

Now, Sergey isn't your regular cryptocurrency CEO who tweets every second. The fact he did tweet this, and directed it at Marc Benioff himself, is a first clue that suggest Sergey could very well be the unknown partner.

A bit later, on April 11th, [suddenly the Salesforce logo turns up on the website.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LINKTrader/comments/8bg7up/4_new_logos_in_revamped_website_appeared_today/)
This is the second clue. As has been discussed often enough, companies don't simply use each others logo on their website. The usage of the official Salesforce logo seems to imply further communications were held and ChainLink was brought on board. 

A third clue is a simple reddit post: [This person claims Sergey was there.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/8aszk6/salesforce_is_working_on_a_blockchain_product/dx1mcoo/?context=3)
We have not yet managed to get more or better information from this source.

The fourth and last clue comes again from what Marc Benioff told in the interview, namely that they hoped to show their blockchain-related project during Dreamforce. This is taking place 25-28th of September this year, coinciding with the much predicted main net release in September/Q3. Also, lots of the companies linked to ChainLink will be attending (source: https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/expo/).

To end this speculated partnership, take note that we still have no confirmation that Sergey Nazarov was at Davos 2018 or CryptoHQ. If you manage to find proof of this, there is a sizable bounty available. Get in touch with the webmaster for more information.
