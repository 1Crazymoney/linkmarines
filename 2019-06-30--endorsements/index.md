# [Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin)
It's funny that today people mention Vitalik Buterin to spread FUD about Chainlink, because Buterin actually [retweeted about Chainlink](http://archive.is/zzNE2) back in 14 Jun, 2016. Later, [he had to delete the tweet](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/911244079660359680) as many started to think Chainlink was supported by Ethereum Foundation.
>"Endorse" is such a strong word. Oracles are awesome. Much harder to argue oracles are worth $32m.
Note that Vitalik finds it just as equally hard to argue that Ethereum is worth its current market-cap today and [wonders if crypto market cap. reaching $500BN is reasonable at all](https://cryptovest.com/laravel-filemanager/photos_fileupload/7/vitalik%20twitter%201312.png).

# [Zeppelin-Os](https://blog.zeppelinos.org/)
OpenZeppelin is a library for writing secure Smart Contracts on Ethereum. [This library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity) is used by 95% of Ethereum smart-contracts today. 
> [ZeppelinOS Partners With ChainLink, the Market Leader in Trusted Oracles](https://blog.zeppelinos.org/chainlink-partnership/)
If ZeppelinOs believes that Chainlink is the Market Leader in Trusted Oracles, then Chainlink is indeed the one and only Market Leader in Trusted Oracles. Partnership with OpenZeppelin would is a huge step forward for Chainlink adoption. Once Chainlink mainnet is released, it will be instantly adopted by thousands of Solidity developers thanks to OpenZeppelin.

# [Andreas Antonopoulos](https://antonopoulos.com/)
Antonopoulos is a best-selling author, speaker, educator, and one of the world’s foremost bitcoin and open blockchain experts. In 2014, Antonopoulos authored the groundbreaking book, Mastering Bitcoin (O’Reilly Media), widely considered to be the best technical guide ever written about the technology.  
In fall of 2018, Andreas is releasing a new book, [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/oracles.asciidoc). He is co-authoring this book with Gavin Wood, the co-founder and CTO of Ethereum. They mention Chainlink as the only decentralized oracle [under Oracles](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/oracles.asciidoc).

# [Nick Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo)
Often speculated as Satoshi Nakamoto, Nick Szabo was talking about smart-contracts in 1996. [In this retweet](https://i.imgur.com/XjWXsUJ.png) there's a subliminal message of his support for Chainlink. The support is further reinforced by the facts that *Mastering Ethereum* is also co-authored by Szabo and Szabo is good friends with Chainlink's technical advisor *Ari Juels*.

# [Ari Juels](http://www.arijuels.com/)
Ari Juels is a Professor at Cornell Tech (Jacobs Institute) in New York City, and Computer Science faculty member at Cornell University. He is a Co-Director of the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3). Ari is Chainlink's technical advisor who co-authored Chainlink's whitepaper. It's probably because of Ari's support that Chainlink is recognized by Cornell's IC3:
> We're partnered with Cornell's IC3, to help launch the first Intel SGX secured link between smart contracts and external data. This more secure way of running an oracle is the future and we're glad to be moving it forward. [source](https://www.smartcontract.com/)

# [The World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/)
The World Economic Forum is an independent international organization committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic and other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas. Chainlink is *industry recognized*:
> We were selected by the World Economic Forum's Tipping Point report as the "Shift in Action" for Smart Contracts, for our work on allowing smart contracts in the Bitcoin network to be automatically triggered by external data. [source](https://www.smartcontract.com/)
