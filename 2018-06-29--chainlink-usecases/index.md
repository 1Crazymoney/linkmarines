# Brief explanation

Weather insurance. Weather insurance for farmers. In case it rains 10 inches, lets insure farmers so that the they get paid automatically. Automate it instead of going through n people and taking a lot of time to settle claims. Because of the finality aspect, the system needs to be tamper proof. The blockchain/smart-contract is, but someone could hack the weather station providing the data that allows the smart contract to know if it's raining or not. Chainlink enables the smart contract to aggregate the information of 10 weather stations and decide whether it's *really* raining or not. So to commit fraud one would have to breach in 10, 100 or even up to 1 million weather stations, depending on Chainlink configuration.

This same logic applies to a large amount of other use cases.
